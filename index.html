		<h1>About Mack Snider</h1>
		<div id="conatiner">
			<p>My name is Mackenzie Snider, but I usually just go by Mack. I am 20-years old and I was born in Waterloo, where I have been residing my entire life. I am very passionate when it comes to the things I love. One of my many passions is sports. I grew up playing hockey and continue to play to this day. My love for sports does not just end at hockey, however. I also very much enjoy soccer, and volleyball. </p>

			<p>While sports are very important to me, I do not believe there are the most cherished hobby I partake in. I have a very strong passion for video editing and videography. I started editing videos when I was 15 years of age. I began making simple hockey edits on Instagram, acquiring a relatively small following. Over the years, I have adapted and expanded my knowledge of not just video editing, but also the video editing community and industry. I have gained a decently sized audience over the past 5 years. I continue to edit hockey videos, but not at a frequent rate, as I try to expand my horizons. I also started putting some of my time into recording videos. I got my first camera about a year ago, and in June of 2020, decided it was time for an upgrade. I recently purchased the Canon T8i. I love both hobbies because they are not only fun but a very important practice as I try to start a career in these fields. </p>

				<h2>About Jackson Cribar</h2>
			<p>My name is Jackson Cribar I was born in London, Ontario and have lived there ever since, In my younger years grew up in the eastern part of the city and if you know anything about that it isn’t the greatest area of the city but when I was around 3-4 we moved to the Westmount area in the south east part of the city and I’ve been there ever since. I went to public at Sir Isaac Brock Public school from grade 1-8 and had a pretty good time for the time I was there, when I was younger I played a lot of video games (like a lot of kids do) I also played hockey up until grade 9. After public school I went to Saunders Secondary for 2 years then I transferred to South Collegiate Institute for the remainder of my high school time. I took a year off school after grade 12 to work and save up some money for post-secondary, because I was not sure what I wanted to do still after I graduated.</p>

			<p>When I was in grade 8, I was playing this game called “garry’s mod” casually, creating little scenes within maps, then slowly progressed into creating little art pieces within other maps. I then eventually found a map that allowed me to have a completely blank slate that I could add anything I wanted to into, and not be constrained by the other map’s limits. Another bonus of this was I could control the lighting on the scene, and It allowed me to take my little hobby to a whole new level. I then discovered a way to merge light layers into photoshop and that as well really took them to a new level, I also learned how to use photoshop from just trial and error, I am hoping with this course that I am taking I can take my art to a professional level. Outside of my art stuff I really like to listen to music and watch movies, and hang out with my friends (cant really do that much now) I collect vintage clothes, mainly old Harley Davidson shirts, band tees and Nascar tees. Besides that there is not really anything else about myself that I can think of. </p>
