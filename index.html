		<h1>About MAck Snider</h1>
		<div id="conatiner">
			<p>My name is Mackenzie Snider, but I usually just go by Mack. I am 20-years old and I was born in Waterloo, where I have been residing my entire life. I am very passionate when it comes to the things I love. One of my many passions is sports. I grew up playing hockey and continue to play to this day. My love for sports does not just end at hockey, however. I also very much enjoy soccer, and volleyball. </p>

			<p>While sports are very important to me, I do not believe there are the most cherished hobby I partake in. I have a very strong passion for video editing and videography. I started editing videos when I was 15 years of age. I began making simple hockey edits on Instagram, acquiring a relatively small following. Over the years, I have adapted and expanded my knowledge of not just video editing, but also the video editing community and industry. I have gained a decently sized audience over the past 5 years. I continue to edit hockey videos, but not at a frequent rate, as I try to expand my horizons. I also started putting some of my time into recording videos. I got my first camera about a year ago, and in June of 2020, decided it was time for an upgrade. I recently purchased the Canon T8i. I love both hobbies because they are not only fun but a very important practice as I try to start a career in these fields. </p>
